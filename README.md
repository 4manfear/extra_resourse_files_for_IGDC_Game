As we continue to streamline our workflows and improve our collaboration, I would like to introduce a dedicated repository for sharing necessary information and files that are not related to Unity. This repository will serve as a centralized location for all relevant documents, resources, and materials, ensuring easy access and efficient sharing among all team members.

Please use this repository for the following purposes:

Uploading and downloading non-Unity files
Sharing project-related documents and resources
Collaborating on non-Unity aspects of our projects
By utilizing this repository, we can maintain better organization, reduce the risk of information loss, and enhance our overall productivity.

Thank you for your cooperation and commitment to our continued success. If you have any questions or need assistance with using the repository, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Best regards.
